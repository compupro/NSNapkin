# NSNapkin
A really old map plotting tool from when I was new to JS.

Intended for NationStates roleplaying audience, but can be used generally as well. Hosted at [nsnapkin.neocities.org](https://nsnapkin.neocities.org)

There is a feature that is not obvious in NSNapkin: while editing, if you right click a marker you have placed down, it will be deleted. While editing, you can also move those markers around.
